### Pointers

- Pointer is just a special type of variable that holds the address of another variable in memory
- when we pass variable into a function (we want to see the behavior)

### No classes in Go

- Go uses user defined types
- we can define our own types

### Constants 

- determine the type

### Functions

- What is a function in go?
- They logically manage the complexity of our program
- reused and logically broken up

- Multiple return values
- Used like any other types
- Supports function literals (when you declare a function in another function(CLOSURE))


### Variadic function

- define a function with ...

### Function Types

- All functions in Go are types
